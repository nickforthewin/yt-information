## About

This app was made to retrieve information from youtube videos. This retrieves information such as:

* Video description

* Video like and dislike count (not abbreviated)

* Video view count (not abbreviated)

This app was also made for developers as a demonstration of the YouTube Data API, not just as an information retriever.

### Frameworks / Resources
This project was made with `react`, `react-router`, and the [Youtube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).
